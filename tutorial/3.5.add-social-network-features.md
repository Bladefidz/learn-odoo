# Add Social Network Features

The social network module (technical name `mail`) provides the message board found at the bottom of many forms, also called Open Chatter, the followers are featured along with the logic regarding messages and notifications.

The social network messaging features are provided by the `mail.thread` model of the `mail` module. To add it to a custom model we need to:
* Have the module depend on `mail`
* Have the class inherit from `mail.thread`
* Have the Followers and Thread widgets added to the form view.
* Optionally, set up record rules for followers.

Here step-by-step adding social network features in `todo_user` model which is inherited from `todo_app` model:

1. Ensure that `todo_app` depends on `mail`.
2. Inherit `mail.thread` abstract model to [`TodoTask`](3.1.extending-model.md) of `todo_user`:
```
...
	_name = 'todo.task'
	-inherit = ['todo.task', 'mail.thread']
... 
```
4. Add the social network widgets at the bottom of the form by modifying inherited view [`view_form_todo_task_inherited`](3.2.extending-views.md). Add this inside `arch` data:
```
...
	<sheet position="after">
		<div class="oe_chatter">
			<field name="message_follower_ids" widget="mail_followers" />
			<field name="message_ids" widget="mail_thread" />
		</div>
	</sheet>
...
```
5. For set up record rules go to [Modifying Data](3.6.modifying-data.md).
