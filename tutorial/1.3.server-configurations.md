# Server Configuration


## In Physical Machine / VM

Odoo databases are incompatibel between Odoo major versions. This means that if you ran Odoo 8 server against an Odoo / OpenERP 7 database, it won't work. Non-trivial migration work is needed before a database can be used with a later version of the product.

By default, Odoo will use the `.openerp-servercc` file in home directory to save most of configuration options. Execute `odoo.py` to start the Odoo server. Here further options to start the server:

* Store the current instance configuration into `.openerp-servercc` and stop after successfully saved:
```
./odoo.py --save --stop-after-init
```
* Use specific configuration file:
```
./odoo.py --conf=<FILE_PATH> --save --stop-after-init
```
* Run Odoo instance with custom port:
```
./odoo.py --xmlrpc-port=8070
./odoo.py --xmlrpc-port-8071
```


### Logging

Use `--log-level` option to set the log verbosity.

* Enable `debug` log level:
```
./odoo.py --log-level=debug
```
* Inspect SQL generated bt the server:
```
./odoo.py --log-level=debug_sql
```
* Log requests/response received/sent by the server:
```
./odoo.py --log-level=debug_rpc
```


### Development Environment

* Enable Python debugger (pdb)
This log mode also making Odoo to automatically reload Python code and upgrade modules.
```
./odoo.py --dev
```
