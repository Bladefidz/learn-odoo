# Inheritance

Odoo is modular framework, so it is very easy for us to extends its capability through provided API without modify the source code. To extend an existing model, use a Python class with a `_inherit` attribute.

Odoo core models exist in a *central registry*. This registry can also be referred to as the *pool*, and can be accessed from model methods using `self.env[<model name>]`. In other word, Odoo implement **Singleton** design pasttern, so any modification in specific module will effect to everywhere.


## Example: Adding sharing capability to the To-Do app

Here the roadmap:

* Add fields to the **Task** model, such as the user who owns the task.
* Modify the business logic to operate only on the current user's tasks, instead of all tasks the user is able to see.
* Add the necessary fields to the views.
* Add social networking features: The message wall and the followers.

**Step by step**:

1. Create **todo_user** module:
```
odoo.py scaffold todo_user <MODULE_PATH>
```
2. Create `__openerp__.py` with following code:
```
{
    'name': 'Multiuser To-Do',
    'description': 'Extend the To-Do app to multiuser',
    'author': 'Daniel Reis',
    'depens': ['todo_app']
}
```
3. Update the **Modules List**.
4. Find and install module called **Multiuser To-Do**.
5. Next, go to [Extending model](3.1.extending-model.md)
